# 🌐 Language Translation using Transformer Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a machine translation system titled `TRANSLATION.ipynb`. It demonstrates how to translate text from one language to another using modern NLP techniques, likely based on Transformer models (e.g., seq2seq, attention mechanisms, or pretrained models like BERT or MarianMT).

## 📁 Files

- `TRANSLATION.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains code, explanations, and examples of language translation.
- (Optional) `requirements.txt`: Add if you want to specify packages used.

## 🚀 Features

- Tokenization and preprocessing of input/output text.
- Model loading and inference using transformer architecture.
- Support for translating between multiple languages.
- Real-time text translation example cells.
- GPU-compatible execution (if applicable).

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers sentencepiece gradio  # example set
